# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

When starting this project I frist, reviwed all the files to see and understand what all the files do and mean. Once I was done with that I moved on to setting up my mouleds and making sure that they have all the coloumes set up. Then I moved on to the routes and made all the requests and gets. After that I set up my env file and and congfig/ server so that every thing would be connected. Lastly I tested my routes in insomnia, to make sure they worked.
